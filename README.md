# Fruit-FasterR-CNN-Detection
Using Pytorch to create multiple Faster R-CNN models to detect images of fruit.

## Modified Faster R-CNN model
I modified PyTorch's torchvision Faster R-CNN class to both give losses and predictions while in eval() mode.

My modified torchvision repository is [HERE](https://github.com/Coldestadam/vision_)
